# Machine Learning Architecture

## 1. ML System Overview

The AI Food Delivery ETA Prediction platform uses a complete machine learning lifecycle to generate accurate delivery time predictions. The system transforms raw operational data into machine learning features, trains predictive models, deploys the best-performing model, and continuously monitors prediction quality in production.

The ML system consists of the following major stages:

- Data Collection
- Data Validation
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Registration
- Model Deployment
- Real-Time Inference
- Model Monitoring
- Continuous Retraining

The architecture is designed to ensure reproducibility, scalability, maintainability, and continuous improvement of prediction accuracy.
## 2.1 Business Problem

Food delivery platforms strive to provide customers with accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) predictions to improve user experience and operational efficiency. However, traditional ETA estimation methods often rely on static calculations or limited real-time information, resulting in inaccurate delivery estimates. These inaccuracies are caused by dynamic factors such as restaurant preparation delays, driver availability and arrival time, traffic congestion, weather conditions, route changes, and delivery distance.

Inaccurate ETA predictions lead to customer dissatisfaction, increased order cancellations, refund requests, negative reviews, inefficient driver utilization, and reduced trust in the platform. They also make it difficult for restaurants to manage food preparation and delivery coordination effectively.

The business requires an intelligent, data-driven ETA prediction system capable of continuously analyzing historical delivery patterns and real-time operational data to generate more accurate delivery time estimates. By improving ETA accuracy, the platform aims to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize delivery operations, reduce operational costs, and build long-term customer trust.
## 2.2 Machine Learning Problem

The objective of the machine learning system is to develop a supervised regression model that accurately predicts the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for food deliveries before the delivery process is completed.

The model learns from historical delivery data and utilizes real-time operational information, including order details, restaurant characteristics, driver information, traffic conditions, weather conditions, and geographical distances, to estimate the expected delivery duration.

The machine learning system must generate predictions using only the information available at the time of prediction, ensuring that no future information is used during inference. This prevents data leakage and allows the model to make reliable real-time predictions.

The trained model should continuously improve as new delivery data becomes available. By leveraging periodic retraining, model monitoring, and version control, the system aims to maintain high prediction accuracy despite changing traffic patterns, seasonal variations, restaurant performance, and driver behavior.

The machine learning solution is designed to operate as a production-grade AI service that supports scalable, low-latency inference through FastAPI while maintaining reproducibility using MLflow, Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions, and GCP.
## 2.3 Problem Type

The AI Food Delivery ETA Prediction system is designed as a supervised machine learning regression problem. The model learns from historical delivery records containing input features and the corresponding actual delivery times.

### Problem Classification

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Learning Type | Supervised Learning |
| Problem Type | Regression |
| Prediction Target | Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in minutes |
| Target Variable | Continuous Numerical Value |
| Prediction Mode | Real-Time Online Prediction |
| Inference Type | Single Prediction per Delivery Request |
| Learning Approach | Batch Training with Periodic Retraining |
| Model Output | Predicted ETA (minutes) |

### Characteristics

- The model predicts a continuous numerical value representing the expected delivery time.
- Predictions are generated when a driver accepts a delivery request.
- The model is retrained periodically using newly collected historical delivery data.
- Training and inference use identical preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines to ensure consistency.
- The system is designed for low-latency predictions suitable for production deployment.
## 2.4 Target Variable

The target variable represents the value that the machine learning model is trained to predict. In this project, the target is the **Actual Estimated Time of Arrival (Actual ETA)** expressed in minutes.

### Target Definition

The Actual ETA is calculated as the total time elapsed between the moment an order is successfully placed and the moment it is delivered to the customer.

**Formula**

Actual ETA = Delivered Time − Order Time

### Target Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Target Name | Actual ETA |
| Data Type | Continuous Numerical Value |
| Unit | Minutes |
| Problem Type | Regression |
| Source | Delivery Service |
| Availability | Available only after delivery completion |

### Business Significance

Accurately predicting the Actual ETA enables the platform to:

- Provide reliable delivery estimates to customers.
- Improve customer satisfaction and trust.
- Reduce order cancellations and refund requests.
- Optimize restaurant preparation and driver scheduling.
- Improve overall delivery efficiency.

### Data Leakage Consideration

The Actual ETA is used **only during model training and evaluation**.

During real-time prediction, the model cannot access the actual delivery time because it has not yet occurred. Therefore, the model uses only the information available at the prediction timestamp, such as order details, driver information, traffic conditions, weather conditions, and restaurant preparation estimates.

This approach prevents data leakage and ensures realistic production predictions.
## 2.5 Input Features
